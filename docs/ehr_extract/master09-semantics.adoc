= Semantics of openEHR and ISO 13606 extracts

== Versioning Semantics

Although for most clinical situations, it is the latest versions of Compositions which are sent to a
receiver, there are requirements for various amounts of version-related information to be included, as
described in Requirements on page 8. At a minimum, Compositions always include the audit trail corresponding
to the particular version which the Composition represents. In some cases, historical versions
of a logical Composition are needed for some medico-legal reason. It may even be required that
the receiver system wants to reconstruct a complete facsimile of the versioned object, logically identical
to its form at the source (but most likely stored in a different versioning implementation).
The openEHR extract specification defines the simplest means of satisfying these needs, namely to
include all Compositions in their whole form, including in the case where they are successive versions
of a single logical Composition such as "family history", as illustrated in the figure below. The main
justification for this is that no assumptions should made on sender or receiver systems to do with their
ability to represent or efficiently process versions. Whole Compositions can always be processed by
even the simplest systems.

It is assumed that any system that wants to be able to determine things such as who was responsible
for changing a certain fragment of a Composition, when some part of a Composition came into being,
or the differences between two particular versions of a Composition, must have version control capability
locally. This usually means having some implementation of a version control model such as the
one described in the openEHR Common Reference Model, which can do efficient versioning, differencing
and so on. Supplying Compositions in their full form ensures that no assumption is made on
what such an implementation might be.

This approach is a departure from the ISO 13606-1:2008 EHR Extract standard, which defines Compositions
so as to include revision history information on every node of the structure. Although it is
not stated in the 13606 specification whether the 'Composition' is in fact supposed to be understood
as a copy of a Composition from an EHR, or as a 'cumulative diff' of Composition versions in an
EHR, analysis shows that only the latter can make sense because the Composition (Composition) is
the unit of creation and modification, and there is logically only one audit trail for each version. Even
the 100th version has associated with it only one audit trail.

This raises the question of whether a 'diff' form of Compositions should be used in the openEHR
Extract, conforming to the ISO standard. The approach was not chosen for a number of reasons:

* it implies that senders can generate 'diff' information structures and that receivers can process them, i.e. it makes more assumptions than necessary about the sophistication of systems;
* the ISO specification appears to be in error with respect to deletions - the sending of logical deletions does not appear to be handled properly;
* the sending of deletions is not normally desired, and may be illegal (e.g. in Europe there are EC directives preventing the sending of statements corrected by clinicians or patients).

It is worth contemplating just how complex cumulative difference information would be. The following figure
illustrates the structure generated by the accumulation of only three changes shown in the successive
versions in the figure below. The large numbers of changes likely in persistent Compositions will generate
far more complex structures.

In conclusion, while sending a difference form of Compositions is not out of the question in a future
when EHR systems are routinely capable of sophisticated version handling, it is considered too complex
currently, and the controls over sending deleted information have not been sufficiently well
described.

== Creation Semantics

The following describes an algorithm which guarantees the correct contents of an EHR extract. The
input to the algorithm is:

* the list of EHR Compositions required in the extract (the "primary" Composition set);
* optionally a folder structure in which the Compositions are to be structured in the extract;
* the `_include_multimedia_` flag indicating whether `DV_MULTIMEDIA` content is to be included inline or not;
* the follow_links attribute indicating to what depth `DV_LINK` references emanating from Compositions should be followed and the Compositions containing the link targets also included in the extract.

The algorithm is as follows.

* Create a new `EHR_EXTRACT` including the folder structure;
* Create a demographics `EXTRACT_CHAPTER` and write the `PARTYs` in;
* For each Composition in the original set, do:
** create an `X_VERSIONED_COMPOSITION`, and set `_is_primary_`;
** for each instance of `OBJECT_REF` encountered (e.g. `PARTY_REF`), obtain the target of the reference from the relevant service, and copy it to the appropriate chapter, e.g. demographics, access_groups tables with the key = the `OBJECT_REF`.`_id_`;
** copy/serialise the Composition into the appropriate place in the folder structure rewriting its `OBJECT_REFs` so that `_namespace_` = "local"
** for each instance of `DV_MULTIMEDIA` encountered, include or exclude the content
referred to by the uri or data attributes, according to the `_include_multimedia_` flag;
** according to the value of `_follow_links_`, for each instance of `DV_LINK` encountered (only from/to Archetyped entities):
* follow the links recursively. For each link: create an `X_VERSIONED_COMPOSITION`;
set `_is_primary_` = False, write the path and write the target Compositions in the extract if not already there;
* create the `DV_LINK` objects so that their paths refer correctly to the Compositions in the Extract;
