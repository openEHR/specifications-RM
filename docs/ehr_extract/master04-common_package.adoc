= Extract.common Package

== Overview

The `rm.extract.common` package defines the semantics common to all kinds of Extract requests
and Extracts. Requests and Extracts can be implemented as messages, or used as types in a webservice
environment. In the latter, the Extract request semantics would most likely be replaced by equivalent
service function definitions.

The Request contains a detailed specification of the repository content required in the Extract. A
Request is not always needed, and an Extract may be sent unsolicited. Requests can be made persistent
and/or event-driven, supporting various periodic and continuous update scenarios. Each request
may specify the data from one or more entities, e.g. EHRs or subjects.

The Extract reply may optionally include a copy of the request. Its main content is in the form of
_chapters_, under which folders and content items contain the requested content, or as much of it as was
possible to retrieve. Specific types of content item, including openEHR content, generic EMR content,
and demographic content are defined in various sub-packages, How the content is arranged
within folders in each chapter, and across chapters is managed by the use of archetypes and templates
for the Extract/chapter structure. The following uML diagram illustrates the `rm.extract.common` package.

== Design

=== Extract Request

The `EXTRACT_REQUEST` class consists of an update_spec specifying rules for update (one-off, periodic,
event-driven etc), and an `_extract_spec_`, indicating what information from the target repository is
required. The latter consists of an optional `_version_spec_`, indicating which versions (default is latest)
and a `_manifest_`, specifying which entities (records or subjects, and optionally which items from those
entities should be included.

==== Content Criteria Specification

The `extract_spec` part of the Request applies to all content in the Extract. The attributes are as follows:

* _extract_type_: what kind of Extract this is, e.g. `|openehr-ehr|`, `|openehr-demographic|`, `|openehr-synchronisation|`, `|openehr-generic|`, `|generic-emr|`, etc;
* _include_multimedia_: a flag indicating whether inline binary objects are included or not;
* _link_depth_: value indicating how many levels of link to follow when constructing the content of the Extract; the default is 0, meaning 'don't follow';
* _criteria_: specifyies queries defining the required content of each entity record;
* _other_details_: an archetypable structure including further extract details.

The `_criteria_` attribute defines in the form of generic queries (i.e. queries that apply sensibly to any
record) which items are to be retrieved from each entity's record. Each query is expressed as a
`DV_PARSABLE` instance, enabling any formalism to be used. The openEHR archetype query formalisms
(AQL) could be used for example. Query expressions use variables such as $ehr to mean the current
EHR from the `_manifest_` list. Queries may be as simple as the following:

[source, sql]
--------
SELECT * FROM $ehr              -- get all items in the record
SELECT /ehr_access FROM $ehr    -- retrieve the EHR_ACCESS object in an EHR
SELECT /ehr_status FROM $ehr    -- retrieve the EHR_STATUS object in an EHR
--------

More sophisticated queries can be used to obtain items corresponding to a specific criteria, e.g.:

[source, sql]
--------
SELECT ....     -- retrieve last 6 months' worth of blood glucose measurements
...             -- retrieve ongoing medications list
......          -- retrieve items relating to active pregnancy
.....           -- retrieve all GP encounter notes since 12-03-2005
--------

To Be Continued:

==== Update Specification

The update_spec part of the Request specifies how the Request is to be processed by the server. The
default situation, requiring no update_spec at all, is a one-off request. Other alternatives include:

* repeat Request with a defined period and/or trigger events;
* persisting the Request in the server so that the requestor can make later repeat requests by referring to a previously stored request by its identifier.

An ad hoc repeat of a request persisted earlier is made using an `EXTRACT_ACTION_REQUEST` with
action set to |repeat|. This specifies only the identifier of a request previously specified using an
`EXTRACT_REQUEST`. Since requests are uniquely identified for all time, there can be no error in the
identification.

==== The Manifest

The `_manifest_` specifies the scope of records to be retrieved in an Extract. In the simplest case, only a single
entity (e.g. patient) and no specific items will be identified (the content will be determined by the criteria in the
`EXTRACT_SPEC` object); this will be used in the vast majority of single-patient request scenarios.
However, some scenarios will be of a batch update nature, including pathology lab result update and
situations where patient records are requested corresponding to a list of referrals received by a hospital
since the last such update. In these cases, the request manifest may identify a number of entities
(i.e. records or patients), each of which will be allocated a separate chapter in the resulting Extract.

The `_item_list_` of each entity manifest identifies individual items using `OBJECT_REF` instances each
containing the `HIER_OBJECT_ID` identifier of a particular top-level object such as a Composition, or
Party. This mechanism for identifying contents of an Extract is only expected to be used when a specific
identifier is known, rather than when items corresponding to filtering criteria are requested. The
latter are specified using the criteria attribute.

==== Version Specification

An Extract request in its simplest form has no version specification, corresponding to the assumption
of 'latest available version' for each matched item. However, in some situations there is a need to retrieve
previous versions, or information about versions. The version specification part of the Extract
request allows this to be done. The possibilities available are as follows.

* _include_all_versions_: the whole version 'stack' of each item matched by the manifest and
retrieval criteria should be returned. Note that the result of this will be all available versions
from the repository in question, which is in general not the same as all versions that have
ever been created, since versions in the same logical version tree may exist at other
repositories due to local modifications that have not been propagated to the target repository
of the Extract Request.
* _include_revision_history_: this flag indicates whether the revision_history of a
`VERSIONED_OBJECT` is to be included in the Extract form of the version

=== Extract

==== Content Specification
The `EXTRACT` consists of a `_request_id_`, an optional `_participations_` list, an optional `_specification_` and a
set of chapters, containing the retrieved content. The `_participations_` attribute denotes parties that were
responsible for creating the Extract. The `_specification_` takes the same form as the extract_spec of the
`EXTRACT_REQUEST`, but in an `EXTRACT` instance, indicates the actual contents of the Extract. This
will usually differ in from the request specification in that it will list in the manifest section the actual
entities (and the identifiers they are known by in the receiver system) retrieved, whereas the request
may not specify any entities (it may rely on query criteria), or it may specify a different set of entities
than were retrievable in the receiver system.

==== Content
The content of an Extract is contained within the chapters attribute, in the form of one of more
instances of the `EXTRACT_CHAPTER` class or its subtype `EXTRACT_ENTITY_CHAPTER`. Within an
`EXTRACT_CHAPTER` the content attribute contains a folder structure made of `EXTRACT_FOLDER`
objects which in turn contain the content items. The folder structure is defined by archetypes, and can
be used to separate the parts of a health record, or group items according to some other scheme e.g.
episode. A specific kind of chapter, the `EXTRACT_ENTITY_CHAPTER`, is used to carry content associated
with a single entity, i.e. patient. This means that an Extract may contain data relating to multiple
entities, i.e. multiple patients.

The `EXTRACT_CONTENT_ITEM` class is subtyped in later sections of this specification to define metadata
for specific kinds of content.

=== Participations and Demographic Referencing

A key difference between an 'extract' or in fact any kind of message carrying information out of a
system environment is that the Extract combines in one place information typically found in multiple
services in the original environment. Two kinds of information routinely included in Extracts are clinical
(i.e. EHR / EMR or similar) and demographic data regarding participations of the subject and
other parties in the activities documented in the clinical information.

Within the openEHR EHR model, a 'participation' is defined by the `PARTICIPATION` class in the
`rm.common.generic` package. Actual participation instances include a performer object (a subtype
of `PARTY_PROXY`), and optionally an external reference object (type `PARTY_REF`). The latter contains
a reference to the demographic entity within a demographic service, provider registry or similar.
Within the Extract, participations occur in two places. In the `EHR_EXTRACT` class, participations are
used to provide information about parties related to the Extract. These are created new with each
Extract (i.e. they are not EHR data that is part of the Extract content. Accordingly, a simplified form
of the `PARTICIPATION` class is used: `EXTRACT_PARTICIPATION`. The only difference is that the
performer reference is a simple string, allowing it to contain a GUID reference to a demographic
party included elsewhere in the same Extract.

Participations also occur in the actual content of the EHR, and in this case, they original structures are
copied faithfully, including any in-line performer information. If there was an `_external_ref_` present,
pointing to a demographic entity that is also to be included in the Extract, this reference is rewritten to
point to a local copy of the demographic entity (using a GUID), within the Entity chapter of the
Extract.

The result of this is that for source data whose original external references are to external demographic
entities, the logical structure is completely preserved within the Extract, with just the reference
being rewritten to the GUID values used in the Extract (which may well come from the original
demographic database or service).

A typical arrangement is to dedicate a single chapter to all demographic entities referenced within the
Extract, optionally with an internal Folder structure. Some example arrangements are illustrated in
the EHR and generic Extract sections below.
