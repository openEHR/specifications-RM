= Preface

== Purpose

This document defines the openEHR Data Types. This document describes the architecture of the openEHR EHR Extract Information Model. This model formally defines the concepts of ‘extract request’, ‘extract’, various kinds of content including openEHR and non-openEHR, and a message wrapper. It covers use cases including EHR system communication, other clinical content messaging, and EHR system synchronisation, as well as providing an equivalent of the {iso_13606-1}[ISO 13606-1 EHR Extract^].

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Academic groups using openEHR;
* The open source healthcare community;
* Solution vendors;
* Medical informaticians and clinicians interested in health information.
* Health data managers.

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs), such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
