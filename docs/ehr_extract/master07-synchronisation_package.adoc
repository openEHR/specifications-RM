= Synchronisation Extracts

== Overview

The UML diagram below illustrates an Extract variant designed for synchronising two openEHR systems. The
specification only allows for a list of Contributions, or Contributions since a certain Contribution; it
also allows the actual versions to be included or excluded. If they are excluded, you can get just Contributions
on their own - i..e find out what the other system has got.
