= Basic Package

== Overview

The `data_types.basic` package, illustrated below, contains types for the concepts of bistate,
state (in a state machine) and real-world entity identifiers (see the openEHR Common IM for a
discussion on identifier types).

=== Requirements

==== Bi-state Values
One of the most basic types of data is boolean or bi-state data. The need here is for a type which both
includes a boolean value, and which inherits from the type `DATA_VALUE`, enabling it to be used as an
`ELEMENT`.`_value_`.

==== State Machine States

A type is required to represent state values of a state machine. In a simple system of data types, a simple
integer would appear sufficient to perform this job. However, in an archetyped framework, a distinct
type is required, so that it can be archetyped not by the constraints used for integers, but by a
state machine definition instead. The type `DV_STATE` is provided for this purpose. An example of a
state machine which models the lifecycle of a medication order is illustrated in the figure below. This definition
would appear in an archetype; the values of a `DV_STATE` object are then restricted to the values
of the states in the definition.

==== Real-world Entity Identification

Real world entities (RWEs) such as people, car engines, invoices, and appointments may all be
assigned identifiers. Although many of these are designed to be unique within a jurisdiction or issuing
space, they are often not, due to data entry errors, bad design (ids which are too small or incorporate
some non-unique characteristic of the identified entities), bad process (e.g. non-synchronised id issuing
points); identity theft (e.g. via theft of documents of proof or hacking). In general, while some real
world identifiers (RWIs) are 'nearly unique', none can be guaranteed so. Therefore, from a strict
computatoinal point of view, RWIs are not treated as reliable identifiers, but as attributes of their
owning objects, in the same ways as names and addresses for example.

Examples of RWE identifiers which are intended to be unique within the space of the issuing authority
or organisation include:

* driver's licence id
* social security number
* passport number
* prescription id

The defining logical characteristic of RWE ids is that they continue to identify the entities in question,
regardless of how they change in time; for example a social security number does not change
when someone changes their hair colour or even their gender (both of which attributes may be
recorded in the database). In general it should be the case that if two RWE ids are equal, they refer to
the same RWE.

At a practical level, RWE identifiers differ from information entity (IE) identifiers in that the former
are generally not assigned by the computing infrastructure that uses them - that is to say, in the production
computing system, such identifiers are no different from other characteristics of the entity,
such as names or addresses.

Note: Some messaging standards make use of a "time validity" or similar attribute on identifier datatypes. 
The recommended way of representing validity timespans of identifiers in openEHR is to model this using archetypes
and templates so that regional or use-case specific needs can be better represented.

=== Design

The model defined here in the `DV_IDENTIFIER` class allows the recording of three things as part of identifying an item of interest:

* the identifier given to the item of interest (mandatory).
* the issuing authority of the kind of id used (e.g. it might be the federal department of health) (optional);
* the assigner of the id to the item being identified. This is usually the organisation which created the item being identified (optional);

In addition, a type of item being identified can also be recorded, such as 'driver's licence' or 'Medicare card'. All fields are text fields, rather than coded, as no definitive vocabularies are available. However, some useful sources of terms exists, such as https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203/index.html[HL7v2 Table 0203^] for the `type` field. If using the latter, it is recommended to use the 'description', not the code.

Only the `identifier` field is mandatory to allow for use cases in which the other fields cannot be populated. However it is strongly recommended to populate the `type` and `issuer` fields where possible. In many cases the `issuer` and `assigner` have the same value, however two fields allow for the situation in which a central issuer provides blocks of identifiers (typically on some kind of form or other paperwork) to other organisations who then assign them to individuals, as is often done with prescription identifiers.

See the {openehr_rm_support}#_identification_package[Support IM specification^] for a further discussion of RWEs and IEs, and the definition of IEs in openEHR.
