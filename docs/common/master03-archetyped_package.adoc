= Archetyped Package

== Overview

The `archetyped` package defines the core types `PATHABLE`, `LOCATABLE`, `ARCHETYPED`, and `LINK`. It is illustrated in <<archetyped_package>>.

=== The PATHABLE Class
The `PATHABLE` class defines the pathing capabilities used by nearly all classes in the openEHR reference model, mostly via inheritance of `LOCATABLE`. The defining characteristics of `PATHABLE` objects are that they can locate child objects using paths, and they know their parent object in a compositional hierarchy. The `_parent_` feature is defined as abstract in the model, and may be implemented in any way convenient.

A number of functions provide the path functionality, of which `item_at_path()` and `items_at_path()` are the key functions. The former returns an item corresponding to a unique path, i.e. a path that resolves against the data structure to a single node. The latter returns a list of items corresponding to a non-unique path. These functions can be used safely using the following pattern, but can also be used without checking the validity of paths, if this is known a priori in the code anyway.

        }
    else {
        list_of_x := items_at_path(a_path)
        //iterate the list
    }
}

=== The LOCATABLE Class
Most classes in the openEHR reference model inherit from the `LOCATABLE` class, which defines the idea of 'locatability in an archetyped structure'. `LOCATABLE` defines a runtime name and an `_archetype_node_id_`. The `_archetype_node_id_` is the standardised semantic code for a node and comes from the corresponding node in the archetype used to create the data. The only exception is at archetype root points in data, where `_archetype_node_id_` carries the archetype identifier in string form rather than an interior node id from an archetype. `LOCATABLE` also provides the attribute `_archetype_details_`, which is non-Void for archetype root points in data, and carries meta-data relevant to root points. The `_name_` attribute carries a name created at runtime. The 'meaning' of any node is derived formally from the archetype by obtaining the text value for the `_archetype_node_id_` code from the archetype `ontology` section, in the language required.

The `_name_` and `_archetype_node_id_` valuesin a `LOCATABLE` instance are often the same semantically, but may differ. For example, in "problem/SOAP" Sections (i.e. headings), the name of a section at the problem level might be "diabetes", but its meaning might be "problem". The default value for `_name_` should be assumed to be the text value in the local language for the `_archetype_node_id_` code on the node in question, unless explicitly set otherwise.

==== Unique Node Identification

`LOCATABLE` descendants may have a `_uid_`, containing a GUID. In the current openEHR architecture, GUIDs are not needed to identify data nodes, since paths are used to reference all nodes inside top-level structures (i.e. `COMPOSITIONs` etc). Accordingly all references between parts of an EHR are represented in terms of `LOCATABLE_REFs` or `DV_EHR_URIs` (the former is a reference to an `OBJECT_VERSION_ID` with a path appended; the latter is the stringified URI form). This would allow for example, one Entry to reference the serum sodium value in another Entry in version 2 of a Versioned Composition for a laboratory test on 12/Apr/2004. The `_uid_` attribute will usually be empty in most EHR data in most openEHR EHR systems.

The exception is the top-level types such as `COMPOSITION`, `EHR_STATUS`, `PARTY` etc for which it is recommended to set the `_uid_` value to a copy of the `_uid_` attribute of the owning `VERSION` object. This enables easy identification of standalone top-level objects in a serialised form.

Another use for `LOCATABLE`.`_uid_` is in EHR Extracts, which contain serialised expressions of EHR content. In an Extract, the `_uid_` could be set on some or all nodes to a value generated by concatenating the `_uid_` of the enclosing Version object (i.e. `VERSION`.`_uid_`) and the unique runtime path to the particular node. This may be useful to the receiver system for the purpose of referencing particular data nodes when communicating to the sender, or another system. This use of uids is not however mandatory, since for each node in an Extract item, the uid can be generated at any time (including at the receiver system).

NOTE: some classes in the openEHR architecture that do not inherit from `LOCATABLE` but require a uid, such as `VERSIONED_OBJECT`, `VERSION` etc, explicitly define their own `_uid_` attribute.

=== Feeder System Audit
The data in any part of the EHR may be obtained from a feeder system, i.e. a source system which does not obey the versioning, auditing and content semantics of openEHR (data in the EHR which have been sourced from another openEHR system are dealt with in the Common IM, Change control section). The `FEEDER_AUDIT` class defines the semantics of an audit trail which is constructed to describe the origin of data that have been transformed into openEHR form and committed to the system. There are a number of aspects to the problem of transforming data for committal into an openEHR system, dealt with in the following subsections.

==== Requirements
The model of Feeder audit is designed to satisfy the following requirements with respect to EHR content sourced from non-openEHR systems:

* record medico-legal audit information from the originating system (e.g. pathology lab system) similar to that captured in the `AUDIT_DETAILS` class in the `change_control` package;
* record information identifying the immediate system from which the content was obtained (might not be the originating system);
* record sufficient information to distinguish incoming items from each other, and to enable the detection of duplicates and new versions of the same item;
* allow the inclusion of the source content either as a link or inline.

==== Design Principles

The design of the Feeder audit part of the reference model is based on a generalised model of data communication in which various elements are identified, as follows:

* _the originating system_: the computer system where the information item was initially created, e.g. the system at a pathology laboratory or a reporting system for a number of laboratories;
* _intermediate systems_: any system which moves information from the originating system to an openEHR system;
* _the feeder system_: the intermediate system from which the information item was directly obtained by the openEHR system; this might be the originating system, or it may be a distinct intermediate system;
* _the committing openEHR system_: the openEHR system where the information item is transformed into openEHR form and committed as a Composition;
* _openEHR converter_: a component whose job it is to convert non-openEHR information into a form compliant with the openEHR reference model and chosen archetypes;
* _original content store_: some EHR systems may have an associated persistent repository of content as received from external systems, e.g. a message or document database.

<<feeder_chain>> illustrates these elements, shown as a "feeder chain", along with typical meta-data available in messages from each system. In general, not much can be assumed about systems in the feeder chain. The originating system may or may not correspond to the place of the clinical activity - it is not uncommon for a pathology company to have a centralised report issuing location while having numerous physical laboratories. There is often limited consistency in the way identifiers are assigned, timestamps are created, and information is structured and coded. In general, information from a feeder system is in response to a request, often a pathology order, although the request/response pattern probably cannot be assumed in all cases.

.Abstract Model of Feeder Chain
image::{diagrams_uri}/feeder_chain.png[id=feeder_chain, align="center", width=80%]

The idea underlying the openEHR Feeder audit model is that there are two groups of meta-data which should be recorded about an imported information item. The first is medico-legal meta-data about its creation: the system of origin, who created it and when it was created. The second is identifying meta-data for the item from the originating and feeder system, and potentially other intermediate systems in the feeder chain, where necessary to support duplicate detection, version detection and so on.

==== Meta-data
The potentially available medico-legal meta-data about the received item is as follows:

* identifier of the originating system (where the item was originally committed);
* identifier of the information item in the originating system;
* agent who committed the item;
* timestamp of committal or creation of the item;
* type of change, e.g. initial creation, correction (including deletion of a subpart), logical deletion (e.g. due to cancellation of order);
* status of information, e.g. interim, final;
* version id, where versioning is supported.

The above information is equivalent to the audit trail and versioning data captured when information created in an openEHR system is committed in a Composition version.

Various kinds of identifying information may be required including the following:

* subject identifier (often more than one, e.g. national patient id, GP's local patient id, lab's local patient id) are usually recorded and may be required for traceability purposes;
* subject identifier(s) may identify someone other than the subject of the record as being the subject of the incoming item;
* location of the feeder system;
* identifier of the feeder system (which may be one of many at the feeder system location);
* identifer the feeder system uses for the item in question (often known as an "accession id");
* identifier of request or order to which the information is a response (sometimes known as a "placer's request id");
* identifier of the information item used by the originating system (sometimes known as a "filler's request id");
* timestamp(s) assigned by feeder system to the item.

Some or all of this information will usually be sufficient to perform a number of tasks as follows.

==== Traceability
The first task is to support medico-legal investigation into the path of the information item through the health computing infrastructure. This requires the availability of sufficient identifier information that the origin of the information item can be traced. Subject identifiers where available should be used to ensure that the received data go into the correct EHR, by ensuring that the relevant lookups in client directories or other lookup mechanisms can be effected. Again, in rare cases, the subject of the incoming data item may not necessarily be the subject of the EHR - a test result may be made from a relative or other associate which will be stored in the patient's EHR.

==== Version Detection
The second is to detect new versions of an item (e.g. interim and final versions of a microbiology test result). This can usually be achieved by using various identifiers as well as the originating system version id and/or content status (interim, final etc). A new openEHR Composition version should always be created for each received version, even where the content does not change at all (e.g. a microbiology test where the result is "no growth" in both interim and final results).

==== Duplicate Detection
Another task is to disambiguate duplicates (often caused by failure of a network connection during sending) coming from the feeder system. In some cases however duplicates are erroneously given new ids by the feeder system, giving the receiver the impression of a new information. In such cases, a further item of meta-data may be required:

* hash or content signature generated (most likely by the converter) from the received information.

==== Differentially Coded Data
A further problem is that the originating system may send new versions of an item which are not complete in and of themselves, i.e. which only include new or changed elements with respect to a previous send of the same item. An example is a system which sends a correction to an HL7v2 blood test message, where the correction includes just the "serum sodium" data item. In this case, special processing will be required in the openEHR converter component, in order to regenerate a full data item from difference data when it is received. Such processing may also have to take account of deleted items.

In summary, the Feeder audit class design tries to accommodate the recording of as much of the above meta-data as is relevant in any particular case. It is up to the design of openEHR conversion front-end components as well as proper analysis of the situation to determine which identifiers are germane to the needs of traceability. In general, any meta-data of medico-legal significance should be captured where it is available.

==== Using Feeder Audit in Converted Data

Although the design of the openEHR converter is outside the scope of the current document, it is worth considering a common design approach, and where the `FEEDER_AUDIT` class fits in. An effective way of converting non-openEHR data such as HL7v2 messages, relational data etc, is in two steps. The first is to perform a 'syntactic' conversion to Compositions containing instances of the `GENERIC_ENTRY` class (described in the Integration IM), using 'legacy archetypes'. The resulting database will contain versioned Compositions containing `GENERIC_ENTRY` instances; logically this database does not contain EHRs but simply external data converted to openEHR computational form. The relevant `FEEDER_AUDIT` instances should be attached to the Compositions containing the corresponding `GENERIC_ENTRY` instances. The second step is to perform a 'semantic' conversion to subtypes of ENTRY, i.e. `OBSERVATION`, `EVALUATION`, `INSTRUCTION` and `ACTION`, according to standardised clinical archetypes. There are various possibilities for what to do with the Feeder audit. The minimum Feeder audit required on the final instance contains the originating system audit information, but none of the information to do with feeder or intermediate systems. This will satisfy medico-legal needs. Alternatively, a complete copy could be made, even though the feeder-related meta-data is probably only of use in the conversion environment. What the Feeder audit looks like in the EHR proper may depend on local legislation, norms or other factors. Alternative conversion approaches are also possible, in which no intermediate form of data exists.

==== Structural Correspondence

There is no guarantee that the granularity of information recorded in the feeder system obeys the rules of Entries, Compositions, etc. As a consquence, feeder information might correspond to any level of information defined in the openEHR models. In order to be able to record feeder audit information correctly, the model has to be able to associate an audit trail with any granularity of object. For this reason, feeder audit information is attached to the `LOCATABLE` class via the feeder_audit attribute, even though it is preferable by design to have it attached to the equivalent of Compositions or at least the equivalent of archetype entities (i.e. Compositions, Section trees and Entries). Its usual usage is to attach it to the outermost object to which it applies. In other words, in most cases, during a legacy data conversion process, the entirety of a Composition needs only one `FEEDER_AUDIT` to document its origins. In exceptional cases, where feeder data comes in in near real time, e.g. from an ICU database, separate `FEEDER_AUDIT` objects may need to be generated for parts of a Composition; each commit in this situation will create a stack of versions of one Composition, with a growing number of `FEEDER_AUDIT` objects attached to internal data nodes, each documenting the last import of data.

The Feeder audit information is included as part of the data of the Composition, rather than part of the audit trail of version committal, because it remains relevant throughout the versioning of a logical Composition, i.e. when a new version is created, the feeder information is retained as part of the current version to be seen and possibly modified, just as for the rest of its content. If the main part of the content is modified so drastically as to make the feeder audit irrelevant, it too can be removed. A second consequence of feeder and legacy systems is that structural data items may need to be synthesised in order to create valid structures, even though the source system does not have them. For example, a system may have the equivalent data of Clusters and Elements (see {openehr_rm_data_structures}[openEHR Data Structures IM] or CEN EN13606), but no Entries, Sections or other higher-level data items; these have to be synthesised during conversion. To indicate synthesis of a data node, a `FEEDER_AUDIT` instance is attached to the `LOCATABLE` in question, and its `_change_type_` set to "synthesised".

==== Original Content

The features of the model described so far allow accurate referencing of content as it is known in source systems and intermediate feeder systems. A further feature of the `FEEDER_AUDIT` class, the original_content attribute allows the original content item itself to be either included inline or pointed to. If a link is used, the usual situation is that the content is in a store associated with the receiving system, such as a message or document database. The content could also be included inline. Since the original_content link is on a `FEEDER_AUDIT` object, more than one can be used within the same generated Composition if required. It may be deemed preferable to attach only a single link at the top node, i.e. the Composition node, since this establishes basic equivalent between the whole Composition and the whole document or message.
