= Representation Package

== Overview

This package contains classes for a simple hierarchical representation of any data structure, as shown on the lower right side of <<data_structures_package>>. These classes are compatible with the ISO 13606-1 classes of the same names, and instances can be losslessly generated to and from EN13606 instances structures.
