= History Package

== Overview

The `history` package defines classes which formalise the concept of past, linear time, via which historical
data of any structural complexity can be recorded. It supports both instantaneous and interval
event samples within periodic and aperiodic series. Data recorded in interval events are tagged with a
mathematical function, including 'point-in-time', 'mean', 'delta' and so on, as defined by the
openEHR `event_math_function` vocabulary. It also supports the inclusion of "summary" data, i.e. a
textual or image item which summarises in some way the entire history.

Regardless of whether the actual data consist of a single sample or many, they are represented in the
same way: as a history of events, i.e. as a time series, allowing all software to access data in a uniform
way, whether it is a single measurement of weight, a long series of three- or four-dimensional images,
or even a series of encapsulated multimedia items.

The model defines the constrained generic (otherwise known as 'template' or 'parameterised') types
`HISTORY<T>`, `EVENT<T>`, `POINT_EVENT<T>`, and `INTERVAL_EVENT<T>` where the `_type_` parameter
is constrained to the `ITEM_STRUCTURE` type, and defines the type of the data recorded in an instance
of `HISTORY`. The effect is that repeated instances of spatially complex data can recur in time, corresponding
to the way data are actually measured. An aperiodic series of `POINT_EVENT` instances
would typically be used to represent manual measurements repeated in time. Periodic histories of
`INTERVAL_EVENT` instances would typically be used to represent vital signs monitor output (which is
usually delivered in averaged form potentially with additional minimum and maximum values).

As with all other parts of the openEHR reference model, the `history` package is designed for archetyping;
archetypes define the domain semantics of `HISTORY` instances. The `history` package is
shown on the left of the figure <<data_structures_package>>.

=== Basic Semantics

The intention of the History model is to represent time-based data for which every sample in the
series is a measurement of the same phenomenon (e.g. patient heartrate) and is obtained using the
same measurement method (e.g. pulse oximeter). Samples taken in this way can be reliably treated as
representing changes in a phenomenon over time, and accordingly can be safely used for time-based
computation, such as graphing, statistical analysis and so on. A History can contain any mixture of
`POINT_EVENT` and `INTERVAL_EVENT` instances. Clearly it is impossible for the model to guarantee
completely correct usage on its own, however there two major safeguards.

Firstly, the use of generic types forces the type of the data in each Event to be the same. A History of
type `HISTORY<ITEM_LIST>` therefore constrains the type of the data at each Event (`EVENT`.`_item_`) to
be of type `ITEM_LIST` and nothing else.

Secondly, the use of archetyping (typically within openEHR Observation archetypes) ensures the
actual structure of the `ITEM_STRUCTURE` subtype is defined in the same way for every sample - e.g. a
two-item list representing systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

=== Timing

An instance of the `HISTORY` class contains the `_origin_`: `DV_DATE_TIME` attribute, indicating what is
considered the '0-point' of the time series, and a series of instances of the `EVENT` subtype, each containing
a `_time_`: `DV_DATE_TIME` attribute representing the absolute time of the event. The relative offset
of any Event is computed as the difference between the `EVENT`.time and `HISTORY`.`_origin_` by the
`EVENT`.offset function. For Interval events (i.e. instances of `INTERVAL_EVENT`), the `_time_` attribute
always refers to the end time of the event, since this is the time at which the data (e.g. average) are
true.

The origin time of a History does not have to be the time of the first sample - it might be the time of
an event such as child-birth with respect to which the samples are recorded, e.g. Apgar scores (Apgar is a 0-10 score indicating the health of a newborn based on breathing, heartrate, colour, muscletone
and reflexes) at 1 and 3 minute offsets. Periodicity and aperiodicity are expressed via the `_is_periodic_` and `_period_`
attributes. For a periodic time-series, `_period_` is set to the period duration value and `_is_periodic_` returns
True. The total duration of the History is given by the `HISTORY`.duration function. The following figure illustrates
a number of variations in History periodicity and Event type.

=== Point Events

The simplest kind of Event in a History is a "point" event, expressed by instances of the class
`POINT_EVENT`, representing an instantaneous value. A `HISTORY` instance may be composed solely of
Point events, as would be the case with a number of blood pressure values measured over time as the
patient changes position. An Apgar result is a typical example of aperiodic point data, typically consisting
of 2 or 3 events, each containing 5 values and a 6th value repersenting the Apgar score for that
time point. Point data may also be available from monitoring devices. For fine-granularity (e.g. 1 second)
data, the number of samples may be too voluminous for the health record, and more efficient
recording in the form of summary Interval events (see below) might be desired. The diagram below illustrates
the structure of a `HISTORY` containing `POINT_EVENTs`.

=== Interval Events

Instances of the `INTERVAL_EVENT` class are used to express values corresponding to an interval in
time. The `INTERVAL_EVENT`.width attribute defines the duration of the interval; and the inherited
time value corresponds to the trailing edge of the event.

The meaning of an Interval event in this model is that the values effectively summarise actual instantaneous
values of a datum that have occurred during the period of the event interval. The mathematical
meaning of the data of any particular interval event is given by the math_function attribute. This is
coded by the openEHR Terminology group "event math function", and takes values such as "minimum",
"maximum", "average", "delta" and so on. The particular math functions used in each Interval
event in a History may vary throughout the History; for example, one 4-hour Interval event might
contain data representing average values, while a following event might contain data representing
maximum values. Such data can be conveniently used for generating sophisticated graphs of the
underlying datum over time. The next figure illustrates a History containing 2 pairs of 4-hour blood pressure
Interval events, with each pair containing maximum and mean blood pressure value structures
for +4h and +8h timepoints (each of which consist of a systolic and diastolic value).

Interval events can overlap other interval or point events within the same History. A common situation
where this occurs is with measurement of different periods of vital signs, such as 4-hourly blood
pressure events, overlapped by a 24-hour event which contains the values over a period of 6 x 4 hour
periods. In general a long Interval event can overlap any combination of Point or Interval events, as
shown in the following figure.

=== Change Data

One subcategory of interval data that deserves mention is change data. There are three event math
function terms used for indicating changes in data values as follows:

* "change": this means that the value recorded is the difference between the value now and
the value some time previously. It can be positive or negative;
* "increase": the value recorded for the change is positive. The name (i.e. `ELEMENT`.name)
chosen for the item in an archetype carries the semantic of positivity e.g. "increase of ....;
rise of....; ....gain" etc;
* "decrease": the value recorded for the change is positive. But the name chosen for the item
carries the semantic of negativity e.g. "decrease of ....; fall of ....; .... loss".

The following examples show how the data and these math functions are coordinated.

* weight last week was 76 kg. Wait this week = 74 kg. Possible instances:


[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]

|"weight loss"      |True       |`Boolean`      |"decrease"

* weight last week was 80 kg. Weight this week = 83 kg. Possible instances:

|"weight increase"  |(+)3kg     |`DV_QUANTITY`  |"increase"
|"weight gain"      |True       |`Boolean`      |"increase"

|===

The use of these math function indicators allows the correct representation of change values, no matter
how they were captured, in a computable form.

=== Summary Event Data

A relatively common situation particularly in laboratory testing is the existence of a "summarising"
event which accompanies more detailed historical data. Examples where this arises include:

* a series of exams with a single radiologist report for all of them (the report might include
one or more key images);
* graphical summary of a dynamic challenge test such as Glucose tolerance test;
* some comment about the pattern of values on a set of observed values in series.

Such data are accommodated within the model via the optional `HISTORY`.summary attribute, which is
itself a structure, archetypable separately from the structure of the main data. In the first example
above, the summary data might consist of an `ITEM_SINGLE` object containing a textual report; in the
second, an `ITEM_SINGLE` object containing a image within a `DV_MULTIMEDIA` instance.

=== Efficient Representation of Fine-grained Device Data

A useful practical consequence of the of Interval Events is that it allows long periods of relatively stable
data to be represented with a single Interval event, while interesting perturbations will be represented
with a number of fine-grained Interval or Point Events. In the example in the next figure, Event
instances are used represent 4 hours of data consisting to 14,400 x 1 second samples from a blood
pressure monitor. The optional `INTERVAL_EVENT`.sample_count attribute can be used to record the
number of original samples summarised in the event. In the illustration, the math_function is shown
as mean; clearly in the first long period, the monitored datum was not absolutely flat. The implication
is that the recording software was configured to regard variations in a small band (e.g. 5mm Hg) as
insignificant, and only to create new Event objects when the underlying values moved outside the
band. Another approach woould have been to create two Interval Event objects for each long period,
one giving minimum value, the other maxium value, still based on the principle of generating one
such pair for periods when the underlying data remained within specified limits. Regardless of the
details, this general approach provides a way to include hours of fine-grained data from devices like
vital signs monitors in very little space; the data simply need to be transfomed into equivalent
openEHR History form first.

=== State

A feature particular to a model of recording historical data for scientific and clinical use is the ability
to record 'state'. In openEHR, 'state' is understood as information pertinent to the correct interpretation
of the primary data. A simple example is where the primary datum is heartrate; useful state data
would be the level of exertion of the subject (resting, after 3 minutes cycling etc). In clinical recording
situations, the state data is often crucial to the safe use of the primary data, since the latter might
be normal or abnormal depending on the patient state. In openEHR there are two ways of recording
state. One is via the use of a separate `HISTORY` structure within the `OBSERVATION` class (see
`ehr.composition.content.entry` package). The other is via the use of the state attribute of
type `ITEM_STRUCTURE` defined in the class `EVENT` itself. Experience with openEHR archetypes and
systems has shown that the latter method corresponds to the most common clinical need, which is to
be able to record the state at the time of the event (the other method allows for the recording of independent
state events). A simple example is the recording of 3 glucose levels during a glucose tolerance
test. The state information for each event is, respectively (in a typical test):

* 0-minute sample: "post 8-hour fast";
* 1-hour sample: "post 75g oral glucose challenge";
* 2-hour sample: "post 75g oral glucose challenge".

The History structure for this example is illustrated in the following figure.
